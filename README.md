## üéØ Why Git Contextor?

**Before Git Contextor:**
- üò© Manually copying code into ChatGPT/Claude
- üîç Searching by keywords, not meaning
- üß© Missing context across files
- ‚è∞ Wasting hours explaining your codebase to AI

**After Git Contextor:**
- üöÄ AI instantly understands your entire project
- üß† Semantic search finds relevant code by meaning
- üîÑ Real-time updates as you code
- ‚ö° 10x faster AI-assisted development

## ‚ú® Features That Developers Love

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| üß† **Semantic Search** | Find code by what it does, not what it's called | `"user authentication"` finds OAuth, JWT, sessions |
| ü§ñ **Auto-Summary** | Automatically creates an AI-generated summary of your project when idle. | Provides a high-level overview for the AI's "thinking step," leading to smarter, more accurate answers. |
| üí¨ **AI Chat & Secure Sharing** | Chat with your repo; share a secure web UI with AI chat and semantic search | Let external collaborators safely interact with your code via AI |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Hardened Security** | Tunnels only expose shared links, not the admin UI | Collaborate externally without risking unauthorized access |
| üîÑ **Real-time Sync** | Auto-updates as you write code | Always current, never stale |
| üåê **Universal API** | Works with any AI tool or IDE | VS Code, n8n, custom scripts |
| üîí **Privacy First** | Runs locally, your code never leaves | Your IP stays protected |
| üéØ **Token Optimized** | Smart context packing for any LLM | Maximizes AI understanding |
| üìä **Beautiful Dashboard** | Monitor indexing and search activity | See your codebase come alive |

## üöÄ Quick Start (30 seconds)

Git Contextor uses an in-memory vector store by default, so you can get started right away without any external dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project directory
cd your-awesome-project

# 2. Initialize the project
npx git-contextor@latest init

# 3. Start the indexing service and dashboard
npx git-contextor start

# That's it! Your dashboard is now running.
# Open http://localhost:3333 in your browser to see it.
```

**That's it!** Your entire codebase is now semantically searchable.

## üéÆ Try It Now

```bash
# Search by meaning, not keywords
npx git-contextor query "how is user authentication handled?"

# Chat with your repository's AI
npx git-contextor chat "Explain the auth flow step-by-step"

# Create a temporary, shareable link for AI-powered code review
npx git-contextor share create --tunnel localtunnel --duration 2h
```

## üî• Real-World Examples

### VS Code Integration (with GitHub Copilot)

Integrate Git Contextor directly with GitHub Copilot Chat to provide deep, semantic context about your entire workspace. This is the recommended way to use Git Contextor in VS Code.

1.  Open your VS Code `settings.json` file (Ctrl+Shift+P, then "Open User Settings (JSON)").
2.  Add the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "git-contextor": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": ["git-contextor", "mcp"],
                "cwd": "/path/to/your/repository"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/repository"` with the **absolute path** to your project folder where you ran `git-contextor init`.

3.  Restart VS Code for the changes to take effect.

Now, when you use `@workspace` in Copilot Chat, it will use Git Contextor's understanding of your codebase to provide more accurate and context-aware answers.

### n8n Workflow
```javascript
// Use the HTTP Request node in n8n
POST http://localhost:3333/api/search
{
  "query": "payment processing code",
  "maxTokens": 2048
}
```

## üåü What Developers Are Saying

> "Git Contextor feels like having a senior developer who has memorized the entire codebase, available 24/7. It has fundamentally changed how I explore and understand large projects."

> "Onboarding new developers used to take weeks. Now, they can ask Git Contextor questions about the architecture and get meaningful answers in seconds. It has slashed our ramp-up time."

> "I cut my 'code archaeology' time in half. Instead of manually tracing function calls, I can just ask 'where is the database logic for user sessions?' and get an immediate, accurate answer."

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Embedding Providers
```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "gemini",        // gemini, openai, or local
    "model": "text-embedding-004",
    "apiKey": "your-key-here",
    "dimensions": 768
  }
}
```

### Smart Chunking
```json
{
  "chunking": {
    "strategy": "function",      // function-aware chunking
    "maxChunkSize": 1024,
    "overlap": 0.25,            // 25% overlap between chunks
    "includeComments": true
  }
}
```

### File Filtering
```json
{
  "indexing": {
    "includeExtensions": [".js", ".py", ".java", ".go"],
    "excludePatterns": ["node_modules/**", "*.test.js"]
  }
}
```

## üí¨ Advanced AI Capabilities

Go beyond simple search. Have a deep conversation with your codebase and securely share its context with collaborators.

- **`git-contextor chat`**: Ask complex questions and get AI-generated answers.
- **`git-contextor share`**: Create temporary, secure links for external AI-powered code reviews.
- **Auto-Summary**: Git Contextor automatically creates an AI-powered overview of your repository. This gives the AI a "thinking step" to understand the big picture before diving into code details.

  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"

    volumes:
      - ./qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage
```
