# Tunnel.corrently.cloud Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the tunnel.corrently.cloud tunnel service integration for Git Contextor. Here's what has been added:

### 🔧 Core Implementation

**1. CorrentlyTunnelProvider (`src/tunneling/CorrentlyTunnelProvider.js`)**
- Full-featured tunnel provider implementing the tunnel.corrently.cloud API
- WebSocket-based tunnel client management
- Event-driven architecture with proper error handling
- Health checking and user information retrieval
- Automatic tunnel cleanup and management

**2. TunnelClient (`tunnel-client.js`)**
- Standalone tunnel client for establishing WebSocket connections
- HTTP request forwarding between tunnel server and local service
- Auto-reconnection logic and connection monitoring
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdown

**3. SharingService Integration (`src/core/SharingService.js`)**
- Added support for 'corrently' tunnel service
- Integrated with existing tunnel management system
- Event handling for tunnel lifecycle management

### 🎛️ Configuration Updates

**1. ConfigManager (`src/core/ConfigManager.js`)**
- Added 'corrently' as default tunnel provider
- Environment variable support (`CORRENTLY_TUNNEL_API_KEY`)
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations

**2. CLI Integration (`bin/git-contextor.js` & `src/cli/commands/tunnel.js`)**
- Updated CLI options to include 'corrently' service
- Added `tunnel test` command for connection testing
- Enhanced error messages and help text

### 📖 Documentation & Examples

**1. User Documentation (`docs/integrations/tunnel-corrently.md`)**
- Complete setup and usage guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Best practices and security considerations

**2. Integration Examples**
- Programmatic usage example (`examples/tunnel-corrently-example.js`)
- Migration script (`scripts/migrate-to-corrently.js`)
- Integration test suite

**3. Updated Feature Documentation**
- Updated sharing documentation with new tunnel service
- Added tunnel.corrently.cloud as the recommended service

### 🧪 Testing

**1. Unit Tests (`test/unit/correntlyTunnelProvider.test.js`)**
- Comprehensive test coverage for the tunnel provider
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Event emitter functionality testing

**2. Integration Tests**
- Basic integration test for functionality validation
- Connection testing without external dependencies

### 🚀 CLI Commands

All tunnel commands now default to using tunnel.corrently.cloud:

```bash
# Test connection
git-contextor tunnel test

# Start tunnel
git-contextor tunnel start

# Check status
git-contextor tunnel status

# Stop tunnel
git-contextor tunnel stop

# List tunnels
git-contextor tunnel list

# Migration from other services
npm run migrate-tunnel
```

### 📋 Key Features

1. **Default Service**: tunnel.corrently.cloud is now the default tunnel service
2. **Environment Variables**: Support for `CORRENTLY_TUNNEL_API_KEY`
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations continue to work
4. **Enhanced Security**: Enterprise-grade tunnel service with authentication
5. **Path-based Tunnels**: Clean URLs like `https://tunnel.corrently.cloud/tunnel/your-path`
6. **Connection Testing**: Built-in health checks and user info retrieval
7. **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper resource management and cleanup
8. **Migration Support**: Easy migration from other tunnel services

### 🔄 Migration Path

Users can migrate from existing tunnel services with:

1. **Environment Variable**: `export CORRENTLY_TUNNEL_API_KEY=your_key`
2. **Migration Script**: `npm run migrate-tunnel`
3. **Test Connection**: `git-contextor tunnel test`
4. **Start Using**: `git-contextor share --tunnel`

### 🎯 Benefits

- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- **Security**: HTTPS tunnels with proper authentication
- **Performance**: Optimized for AI agent interactions
- **Persistence**: Tunnels remain active until manually stopped
- **Clean URLs**: Professional-looking tunnel URLs

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for use. Users can now enjoy the benefits of tunnel.corrently.cloud as their default tunnel service for Git Contextor sharing capabilities.
