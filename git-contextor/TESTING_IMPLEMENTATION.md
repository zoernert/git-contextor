- **E2E Tests**: 15-25 scenarios
- **Total Test Execution**: < 3 minutes

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1)
1. **Resolve Tree-sitter Issues**: Implement proper mocking
2. **Fix API Method Mismatches**: Align tests with actual implementations
3. **Complete Mock Setup**: Ensure all external dependencies are mocked
4. **Optimize Test Performance**: Reduce execution time

### Phase 2: Expand Coverage (Week 2)
1. **Complete Missing Tests**: Add tests for uncovered components
2. **Add Edge Case Testing**: Error conditions, boundary cases
3. **Improve Integration Tests**: Real service interactions
4. **Add Performance Tests**: Load testing, memory usage

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Week 3)
1. **E2E Workflow Testing**: Complete user scenarios
2. **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Different environments
4. **Documentation Testing**: Code examples, tutorials

## Test Execution Strategy

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# Daily development
npm run test:watch

# Before commits
npm run test:unit
npm run test:coverage

# Before releases
npm run test:ci
npm run test:e2e
```

### CI/CD Pipeline:
```yaml
test:
  - unit: npm run test:unit
  - integration: npm run test:integration
  - e2e: npm run test:e2e
  - coverage: npm run test:coverage
  - quality-gate: coverage > 85%
```

## Benefits of This Testing Strategy

### 1. **Quality Assurance**
- Catch bugs early in development
- Ensure consistent behavior across environments
- Validate all user-facing functionality

### 2. **Development Velocity**
- Faster debugging with targeted tests
- Confident refactoring with safety net
- Automated regression testing

### 3. **Documentation**
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Clear examples of expected behavior
- API usage patterns

### 4. **Maintenance**
- Easier to identify breaking changes
- Simplified troubleshooting
- Better understanding of component dependencies

## Recommendations for 100% Coverage

### 1. **Prioritize Core Functionality**
- Focus on business-critical components first
- Ensure all main user workflows are covered
- Test error scenarios thoroughly

### 2. **Use Test-Driven Development**
- Write tests before implementing features
- Ensure testability is built into design
- Maintain test coverage as code evolves

### 3. **Automate Everything**
- Run tests on every commit
- Generate coverage reports automatically
- Block deployments with insufficient coverage

### 4. **Regular Review and Maintenance**
- Review test coverage weekly
- Update tests when requirements change
- Remove obsolete tests promptly
